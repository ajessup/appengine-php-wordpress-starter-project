{"name":"WordPress for Google App Engine","tagline":"WordPress, super-charged to run on Google App Engine","body":"This project will help you get started with Wordpress on Google App Engine.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n1. Install the [PHP SDK for Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_PHP) on your local development environment\r\n\r\n2. Install [MySQL 5.5](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) in your local development environment, if you haven't already\r\n\r\n3. [Sign up](http://cloud.google.com/console) for a Google Cloud Platform project, and\r\nset up a Cloud SQL instance, as described [here](https://developers.google.com/cloud-sql/docs/instances) You'll want to name your Cloud SQL instance \"wordpress\" to match the config files provided here.\r\n\r\n4. Download the [WordPress for Google App Engine](https://github.com/ajessup/appengine-php-wordpress-starter-project/blob/gh-pages/google-appengine-wordpress-latest.tgz) getting started project and extract it.\r\n\r\n## Edit the config files\r\n\r\nEdit `wordpress/wp-config.php` and `app.yaml`, replacing `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` to match the Project ID (not the name) you entered in the Cloud Console when you signed up for a Google Cloud Platform project.\r\n\r\n## Set up your local database\r\n\r\nUsing MySQL, run `setup.sql` to set up your local database. For a default installation (no root password) this would be: \r\n\r\n    /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u root < setup.sql\r\n\r\n## Run WordPress\r\n\r\nTo run WordPress locally on Windows and OS X, you can use the \r\n[Launcher](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_PHP) \r\nby going to **File > Add Existing Project** or you can run one of the commands below. \r\n\r\nOn Mac and Windows, the default is to use the PHP binaries bundled with the SDK:\r\n\r\n    $ dev_appserver.py path_to_this_directory\r\n\r\nOn Linux, or to use your own PHP binaries, use:\r\n\r\n    $ dev_appserver.py --php_executable_path=PHP_CGI_EXECUTABLE_PATH path_to_this_directory\r\n    \r\nNow, with App Engine running locally, visit `http://localhost:8080/wp-admin/install.php` in your browser and run the setup process, changing the port number from 8080 if you aren't using the default. \r\nYou should be able to log in, and confirm that your app is ready to deploy. \r\n\r\n### Deploy to App Engine\r\n\r\nIf all looks good, you can upload your application using the Launcher or by using this command:\r\n\r\n    $ appcfg.py update APPLICATION_DIRECTORY\r\n    \r\nJust like you had to do with the local database, you'll need to set up the Cloud SQL instance. The SDK includes tool for doing just that:\r\n\r\n    google_sql.py <PROJECT_ID>:wordpress < setup.sql\r\n    \r\nThis launches a browser window that authorizes the `google_sql.py` tool to connect to your Cloud SQL instance.\r\n\r\nNow, just like you did when WordPress was running locally, you'll need to run the install script by visiting:\r\n\r\n    http://<PROJECT_ID>.appspot.com/wp-admin/install.php\r\n\r\n## That's all! (PHEW)\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You should now have a blog that loads rapidly, caches elegantly, \r\nsends email properly, and can support adding images and other media to blog posts! Most importantly, \r\nit will take advantage of Google's incredibly powerful infrastructure and scale gracefully to\r\naccommodate traffic that is hitting your blog.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
